# JSON and File Validation Fixes - Quick Summary

## All Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. ✅ File Format Verification (GIF vs WEBP mismatch)
- Added magic byte verification in `exhibitorBrandingController.js`
- Files are now validated by actual content, not just extension
- Prevents uploading GIF as WEBP or any format mismatch

### 2. ✅ JSON Feed for Each Exhibition  
- **NEW Endpoint**: `GET /public/exhibitions/:exhibitionId/feed.json`
- Returns complete exhibition data with all exhibitors and products
- Includes full image URLs and metadata

### 3. ✅ Full Paths for Product Images
- Changed from filenames only to complete URLs
- Example: `"product.jpg"` → `"https://domain.com/uploads/path/to/product.jpg"`
- Empty string returned if no image (no more `null`)

### 4. ✅ Fixed Download Links
- **NEW Endpoint**: `GET /public/exhibitions/:exhibitionId/exhibitors/:exhibitorId/documents/:documentId/download`
- Handles multiple file path scenarios (production/dev)
- Returns file with proper headers for download

### 5. ✅ No More `null` in JSON
- All `null` values converted to empty strings `""`
- Applied to all public API endpoints
- Recursive sanitization for nested objects

### 6. ✅ File Upload Restrictions for Trade Fair Checklist

**Trade Fair Logo** (`logo_targowe`):
- Format: PNG only
- Size: Max 50 KB
- Dimensions: 300x200

**Product Images** (`zdjecie_produktu`):
- Format: JPEG/JPG only
- Size: Max 5 MB
- Dimensions: Max 1280x960

**Download Materials** (`materialy_do_pobrania`):
- Format: PDF only
- Size: Max 20 MB

### 7. ✅ All Data as Strings, Not Numbers
- All numeric values converted to strings
- IDs, counts, sizes, areas - all strings now
- Example: `{"id": 123}` → `{"id": "123"}`
